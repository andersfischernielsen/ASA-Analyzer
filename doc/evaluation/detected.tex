\subsection{Detectable Error Types}

The detectable error types are highly dependent on the input analyses, given that if an analysis for an error type is not implemented and dynamically loaded when running the Analysis Engine, the error will not be detected. At the time of writing, only analyses described in this section have been implemented for the described error types.
