\section{Future Work}

\newpar The dynamic nature of the implementation should be made more type-safe when users provide analyses. Validating whether a given input analysis matches the expected structure of the framework should be implemented in order to reduce errors on the user's end. This could be accomplished either by dynamically verifying that members are present on the input analyses or attempting to implement the framwork in a strongly typed language, though this might not prove to be possible due to the requirement of dynamic loading.
