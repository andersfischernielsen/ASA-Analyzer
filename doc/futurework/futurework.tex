\newpar As mentioned previously, only set-based analyses are supported by the framework. A generalized lattice structure has not been determined and a user can therefore not load arbitrary lattice structures and accompanying monotone transfer functions. This significantly restricts which analyses can be run on the input programs. The current set-based implementation of analyses should be generalized in future work to support arbitrary lattices and transfer functions in order to make the framework more flexible and allow supporting other analysis types. 

\newpar The dynamic nature of the implementation would benefit from having a stricter, type-safe way for users to provide analyses. Validating whether a given input analysis matches the expected structure of the framework could be implemented, in order to reduce errors on the user's end. This could be accomplished either by dynamically verifying that members are present on the input analyses or attempting to implement the framwork in a strongly typed language, though this might not prove to be possible due to the requirement of dynamic loading.

\newpar Employing a more robust parsing implementation for parsing the input language and generating the CFG would improve the stability of the analysis and allow for greater expandability of the framework. The choice of the Python package ecosystem could be reconsidered, and a different language could be chosen to make traversing the input language easier. Implementing a parser for a different input language might give better results due to the instability of the C parsing of the current implementation. Python has elegant built-in support for parsing Python itself and writing analyses for subsets of Python might result in a better end result.

\newpar Extending the input language could provide more interesting analyses. If the extended language has constructs similar to popular programming languages in use, such as JavaScript, Java and Python\cite{github:languages}, these analyses could provide interesting results for developers in using these languages.
