\section{Conclusion}

In this report we have shown how an Analysis Engine supporting dynamic loading of analyses can be implemented in Python. Furthermore, we have evaluated this Analysis Engine on the implemented analyses, showing that we are able to detect the error types which these analyses support, albeit with some imprecision due to the nature of the analyses. 

\newpar The Analysis Engine only detects error types for which a suitable analysis has been implemented, and there are therefore error types which are undetectable by the implementation. We have detailed how these analyses should be implemented and how the Analysis Engine could be improved in future work to improve its stability and error detection rate by supporting different input languages or implementing the core structure of the Analysis Engine differently.
